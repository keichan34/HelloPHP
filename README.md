# HelloPHP

A rudimentary reverse proxy for PHP.

Proxies requests to other servers.

Usage of this script should be taken with great care (and used only in dire circumstances).

The performance characteristics are shaky at best. I really mean it when I say, "use only in dire circumstances".

## Usage

Read `configuration.example.php`, copy it to `configuration.php`.

Read `index.php`.

Set up `.htaccess` to rewrite everything into your script.

## Why??????

Once upon a time, I had to deploy a WordPress installation on a particularly hostile environment. There were no militant groups trying to stop me at gunpoint, but it was close. PHP 5.1, no database, no write access to the filesystem (not even to /tmp!).

And WordPress was a must.

An offsite database worked until the problem of not being able to save images hit us.

Then, it struck me! I'll just use a silly little script to forward all requests to a much better server that I have complete control over. Goodbye PHP 5.1 troubles, hello WordPress 3.5.
